# C++ Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

## Types of Operators
| Operation | Symbol | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| addition | +  | $x+y$ |
| minus | -  | y-x |
| multiplication | * | x*y |
| divide | / | y/x |
| modulus | % | x%y |
| increase by 1 | ++ | x++ |
| decrease by 1 |   - -  | y - - |
| less than | < | x<5 |
| greater than | > | 5>x |  

# Assignment operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
| Operator | Example | Same as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | x=5 | x=5 |
| += | x+5 | x=x+5 |
| -= | x-5 | x=x-5 |
| /= | x/5 | x=x/5 |
| %= | x%5 | x=x%5 |

# Logical Operators


|Operator|Name|Description|Example|	
|&& |Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true |	x < 5 && x < 10 |
| || |Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true |	x < 5 || x < 4 |
| !  |Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true |!(x < 5 && x < 10) |
 



### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
A list of all comparison operators:

Operator|	Name|	Example|
|==	|Equal to	|x == y	|
|!=	|Not equal	|x != y	|
|>	|Greater than|	x > y|
|<	|Less than	|x < y|
|>=	|Greater than or equal to	|x >= y	|
|<=	|Less than or equal to	|x <= y|
