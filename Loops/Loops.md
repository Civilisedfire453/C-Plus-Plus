# Loops in C++

Loops are a very important part of programming, as they allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are three types of loops in C++:

* **For loop**
* **While loop**
* **Do while loop**

## For loop

The for loop is the most common type of loop in C++. It has the following syntax:

```c++
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code block to be executed repeatedly
}
```
