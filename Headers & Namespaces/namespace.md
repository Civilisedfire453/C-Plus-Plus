# Name Space
This section contains
information about namespace's
in C++  

## Sample
```c++
#include iostream // default header 
using namespace std; //standard name space
```

Namespace: It allows the group entities such as classes and functions, as well as objects under name (i.e. std;).

If we are not using the namespace in the starting of the program then we cant use the functions object and classes which are present inside the namespace this changes the syntax to 

``` c++
std::cout<<"Hello World";

```
