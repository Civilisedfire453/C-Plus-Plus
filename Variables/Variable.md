# C++ Identifiers 
To prior to variables, we must be familar with identifiers. As the name suggests are used to identify a variable , class, function, module, or any other user defined term.

An identifier starts with the letters A-Z or a-z or an underscore followed by more letters of numbers



# Revserved Keywords in C++
Reserved words are words that cannot be used as identifiers in a programming language, they are not necessarily meaningless. Reserved words in a programming language typically have special meanings and are used to represent specific concepts or operations within the language.

Additionally, the number of reserved words in C++ may vary depending on the version of the language being used. In the latest version of C++ (C++20), there are a total of 95 reserved words. However, older versions of the language may have a different number of reserved words.

Some examples of reserved words in C++ include "int", "double", "void", "if", "else", "while", "class", "public", "private", "virtual", "const", and "static". These words have specific meanings within the language and cannot be used as variable names or other identifiers.



# C++ Varibles  
In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

``` c++ 
    int  - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.
```

``` c++ 
    double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 .
```
``` c++ 
    char- stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes.
 ```

``` c++ 
bool- stores values with two states: true or false.
 ```
 

# C++ Data Types

| Type | Keyword | Information | Range | Size(bytes) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boolean | bool | Provides true or false | True or False | 1  |
| character | char | stores a single character | -126 to +127 | 1 |
| integer | int | Stores digit and precision | -32768 to +32767 | 2 |
| floating point | float | store decimal numbers  | -3.4*10^-38 to 3.4*10^38  | 4 |
| double floating point | double | store double precision | -1.7*10^-308 to 1.7*10^308  | 8 |
| void  | null | store nothing  | 0 | 0 |
